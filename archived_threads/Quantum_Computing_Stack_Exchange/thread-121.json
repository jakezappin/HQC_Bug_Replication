{"question": "\nI'm trying to use IBMQ job manager to submit a list of quantum circuits (300 of them in total) to 'ibmq_16_melbourne'. This is what the job status looks like on IBM Quantum Experience: \nI don't know why my code doesn't work on this real quantum computer. If I use the ibmq_qasm_simulator instead then no error has occurred. Here's the structure of my code:\nfrom qiskit import IBMQ\nIBMQ.load_account()\nprovider = IBMQ.get_provider()\nbackend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_16_melbourne')\njob_manager = IBMQJobManager()\n\nall_circuits = [...]    # A list with 300 elements.\nMyExperiments = job_manager.run(all_circuits, backend=backend, shots = 100)\nresults = MyExperiments.results()\n\nI tried another list with 5 simple circuits and it worked fine, but I'm wondering how can I make  it work in my case with 300 circuits? What should I do? Thanks a lot for your help:)\n", "answers": [], "comments": ["It seems like you tried to do some additional operation with the quantum circuit after measurement is being executed, yes? If that is the case then that might be the issue.", "@KAJ226 Thanks for the comment! Could you explain a bit more about the 'additional operation'? I checked out the error message page and it looks like that's the case, but I don't think I have any gates added after the measurement.", "Can you post the circuits you are executing or the code to generate the circuits you are looking at?", "What I mean by additional operation after measurement is if you tried to apply some quantum gates after applying the measurement operator... This is because IBM hardware is not yet supporting mid-circuit measurement (at least on the public available devices). So says, you apply a Hadamard gate, make a measurement, then apply another hadamard gate after the measurement. This will give you an error."], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/15550/why-do-i-get-the-error-ibmqmanagedresultdatanotavailable?r=SearchResults"}
