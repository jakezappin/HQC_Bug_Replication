Without entering in a lot of details, here are your options:\n\nRun your code in a Jupyter notebook: Copy paste your code in a Jupyter notebook, other locally, in IBM Quantum Lab (it has Qiskit preinstalled), or in Google Colab, for example.\nUse a different drawer: Change your last line to print(entangler), this will print your circuit in text mode.\nSave the output into a file: Change your last line to entangler.draw(output=\"mpl\", filename='entangler.png'). This will save the image as a PNG file.\n\n", "\nIf you are running in a python script, then you need to either save the figure, or you need to display the generated figure.
