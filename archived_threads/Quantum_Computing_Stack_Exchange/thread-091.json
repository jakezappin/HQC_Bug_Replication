{"question": "\nwe made the strange observation that the evaluation of the output in form of the dimod.SampleSet takes a long time to evaluate especially in comparison to the actual sampling step. Here is a minimal code example\nimport networkx as nx\nimport dimod\n\nK_7 = nx.complete_graph(7)\nbqm = dimod.generators.random.ran_r(1, K_7)\n\nstart = time.time()\nhybrid_solver = LeapHybridSampler(solver = None, connection_close = False, token = TOKEN)\nprint('\\nDuration init hybrid sampler', time.time() - start)\n\nstart = time.time()\nsample_set = hybrid_solver.sample(bqm, time_limit=TIME_LIMIT_CLASSIC_SOLVER)\nprint('\\nDuration get sample', time.time() - start)\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nprint(sample_set)\nprint('\\n Duration print sample set', time.time() - start_time)\n\nwith the following output\nDuration init hybrid sampler 2.8732540607452393\n\nDuration get sample 2.669390916824341\n   0  1  2  3  4  5  6 energy num_oc.\n0 -1 +1 +1 -1 -1 +1 +1   -9.0       1\n['SPIN', 1 rows, 1 samples, 7 variables]\n\n Duration print sample set 13.532737016677856\n\nThis means that the evaluation of the print statement right after the sampling of the hybrid solver is done, takes a long time to evaluate, much longer than the actual init and sampling step. We further made the observation, that if I print the sample set in another cell after waiting for roughly 13 seconds, the print statement is almost immediately evaluated. I also switched 'connection_close' from True to False and vice versa but nothing changed.\nThis makes me guess that there is still some sort of connection of the hybrid sampler to the backend ongoing which first needs to be closed before the sample set can be evaluated/printed locally.\nAny ideas on how to fix this?\nThanks in advance and best regards,\nSimon\nEDIT: The question was answered in the dwave community forum: https://support.dwavesys.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/4403113729943-Output-of-LeapHybrid-takes-long-to-evaluate?page=1#community_comment_4403163648279\nThe reason is that the processing happens asynchronously.\n", "answers": [], "comments": ["Hi @Simon and welcome :) Nice to see that you got the answer to your question. Self-answering is a possibility on this website and is a good way to answer a question.
