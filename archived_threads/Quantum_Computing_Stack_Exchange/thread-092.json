{"question": "\nTrying to count the number of uses of my circuit AA in Grover iterate circuit Q=\u2212AS0A\u2020SxQ=\u2212AS0A\u2020Sx.\nHowever, Qiskit's amplitude estimation algorithms such as IAE or FAE\naccept only precision arguments like e.g. confidence of solution, error. I run them like this:\nfrom qiskit.algorithms import IterativeAmplitudeEstimation, EstimationProblem, FasterAmplitudeEstimation\n\nproblem = EstimationProblem(state_operation=myqc, objective_qubits=[0])\nalgorithm = IterativeAmplitudeEstimation(**kwargs)\nresult = algorithm.estimate(problem)\namplitude = result.estimation\n\nHow can I get the number of total iterations along with the result or at least get the circuit?\nDo I need to create my own implementations of the algorithms?\n", "answers": ["\nFor the number of iterations, you can do\nfor i,j in enumerate(result_delta._estimate_intervals):\n    print(i,np.mean(j))\n\nFor the circuit result, you can try to do result.circuit_results, it might return a Statevector or counts dictionary.\nand algorithm.construct_circuit(problem) to check the problem circuit.\n#recommend way to view the problem gate\nfrom qiskit import transpile\ntranspile(ae_delta.construct_circuit(problem),basis_gates = ['ry', 'cx','ccx','x']).draw()\n\nFor any more related coding questions, you can just do something like dir(result) to see its attribute, then check sources code or docs about these attributes for the explanation.\nhope it is something you are looking for\n"], "comments": ["accept answer will help a lot thank you", "Thanks a lot for your advice!. Could you elaborate a bit further about the estimate_intervals attribute? How is it supposed to help? And why not use num_oracle_queries?", "I think you can simply look at the docs and sources code to understand that,  num_oracle_queries Return the number of Grover oracle queries. and estimate_intervals Return the confidence intervals for the estimate in each iteration.", "Docs helped indeed, but you confused me a bit since I was asking for iterations/queries and you said about estimate_intervals. Nevertheless, you helped a lot so I can give you this answer."], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/26714/qiskit-get-number-of-iterations-for-iterative-amplitude-estimation?r=SearchResults"}
