{"question": "\nI am trying to run this QSVM tutorial using qiskit from my Python environment using Jupyter Notebook\nFirstly it gives me an error that I have to install qiskit-aqua[cvx] when I try to run this code -\nbackend = BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')\nquantum_instance = QuantumInstance(backend, shots=1024, seed_simulator=seed,seed_transpiler=seed)\nresult = qsvm.run(quantum_instance)\n\nThen after I install the above package. I keep on getting the error - 'BrokenProcessPool: A process in the process pool was terminated abruptly while the future was running or pending.'\nI also try using the following code at the beginning of the notebook as per here https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/924. But no luck.\nimport os \nos.environ['MPMATH_NOSAGE'] = 'true'\n\nAny help is highly appreciated.\nRegards,\nSourav\n", "answers": ["\nPlease create a new conda env & install all reqd packages in there\nConda create a new env -https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\nConda activate your env & install these stuff \n\nconda install python=3.8.3\nconda install -c anaconda pandas\nconda install -c anaconda cmake\nconda install -c anaconda libxml2\nconda install scikit-learn\nconda install cryptography\nconda install -c anaconda libxslt\nconda install -c anaconda pandas\nconda install h5py \nconda install pytest\nconda install -c conda-forge cvxpy\nconda install -c conda-forge pymetis\nconda install -c conda-forge cvxopt\nconda install -c conda-forge cvxpy\nconda install ipywidgets\nconda install lxml\nconda install wheel\n\npip install qiskit-ibmq-provider\npip install qiskit-terra\npip install qiskit-ignis \npip install qiskit-aqua==0.8.2\npip install qiskit-aer==0.7.3\nPip install qiskit  # this will update qiskit aqua \n\nAfter installation try to run this example https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/machine_learning/01_qsvm_classification.ipynb\n", "\nI finally could make it work with\nqiskit-aqua[cvx]\nqiskit-terra': '0.16.4',\nqiskit-aer': '0.7.6',\nqiskit-ignis': '0.5.2',\nqiskit-ibmq-provider': '0.12.2',\nqiskit-aqua': '0.8.2',\nqiskit': '0.24.1'\nAnd by increasing the core and memory.\nThanks for all help.\nRegards,\nSourav\n"], "comments": ["Hi and welcome to the community! Quick questions : what is your Python version and the Qiskit version you are running? I remember some problems of versions for old versions of Qiskit with the latest version of Python, you can run this two lines to get both on a notebook import qiskit.tools.jupyter and then  %qiskit_version_table", "@Lena added below", "According to this upgrading to python 3.8 worked to fix the issue, did you try?", "@Lena - No. I cannot upgrade to 3.8. It is a bit restricted env.", "Do you have the same issue with qiskit 0.23.6?", "@Lena- Just tried with qiskit 0.23.6. All other versions remaining the same as below. No luck though.", "Creating a new conda env is not an acceptable solution. creating a completely new conda env is not a solution in my case the end user cannot create a new conda env. The entire purpose wud be defeated. if that is the only solution I need a solution where user can run the tutorial just doing only pip install from teh Notebook."], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/16800/issue-in-running-the-qiskit-tutorial-for-qsvm?r=SearchResults"}
