{"question": "\nI want to implement noise in Pennylane using qiskit as a plug-in. I found this tutorial from Pennylane. But, when testing it the bit-flip error seems to have no effect at all.\nHere, I made some slight modifications: I take the expectation value of PauliX and can choose 0 or 1 is an initial state.\nimport qiskit.providers.aer.noise as noise\n\n# create a bit flip error with probability p \np = 0.9\nmy_bitflip = noise.pauli_error([('X', p), ('I', 1 - p)])\n\n# create an empty noise model\nmy_noise_model = noise.NoiseModel()\n# attach the error to the hadamard gate 'h'\nmy_noise_model.add_quantum_error(my_bitflip, ['h'], [0])\n\ndev4 = qml.device('qiskit.aer', wires=1, noise_model = my_noise_model)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev4)\ndef bitflip_circuit_aer():\n    qml.BasisState(np.array([1]),wires=[0])\n    qml.Hadamard(0)\n    return qml.expval(qml.PauliX(0))\n\nprint(bitflip_circuit_aer()) \n\nIt does not make any difference whether I choose p=0.0 or p=0.9. I always get +1 for initial state 0 and -1 for initial state 1, as if there was no noise at all.\nThe tutorial is from May 2021. Did something decisive change since then?\n", "answers": ["\nIf you are starting with |0\u27e9|0\u27e9 state.\nThan after HH you are in |+\u27e9=|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9|+\u27e9=|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9 state, which is eigenstate of XX, with eigenvalue +1+1.\nIf XX will happen (in case of an error in probability pp), the state will not change at all, and no error will happen:\nX|+\u27e9=X|0\u27e9+X|1\u27e9=|+\u27e9X|+\u27e9=X|0\u27e9+X|1\u27e9=|+\u27e9\nSo the error of XX and no error is the same thing, and measuring in XX base, will always give you the same measurement value since |+\u27e9|+\u27e9 is eigenstate of XX.\nThe same thing is happening with |1\u27e9|1\u27e9 initial state. Try the math, I can write it too if you like. The only different thing will be a global phase of minus in case of XX error, which is not affecting the measurement result.\n"], "comments": ["Yes, of course, thank you. I totally overlooked this.
