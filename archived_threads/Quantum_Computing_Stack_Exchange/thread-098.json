What is happening vice what do you expect to happen?", "The output circuit image with emojis is shifted and misaligned.", "I would assume that the problem is the emoji in question have a terminal cell width of 2, rather than 1, and circuit.draw() doesn't compensate for wide characters. \u03b8 and \u03c8 have a width of 1 terminal cell, while \ud83d\ude80, \ud83c\udf33 and \ud83e\udd16 have a width of 2 terminal cells, i.e. are treated as wide characters, like Han ideographs. No one has built what I would consider to be a modern terminal yet, anachronisms  such as wide characters are deeply embedded in terminal/console solutions.  You may have to try it using another drawing format, not sure if the draw method has wide character support.", "Thank you \ud83d\ude4f for the clarification...cheers"], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/34407/anyone-know-how-to-fix-this-alignment-issue?r=SearchResults"}
