Patrick pointed out in the comment that if you are using qiskit version 0.20.0 or later then you wouldn't have the unroll error.\nHowever, there is also a problem with your circuit of not having measurement but then you tried to get the counts value of the experiment to plot the histogram... so I took what you did and fixed it.
