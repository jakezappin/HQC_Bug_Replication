Can you look at it?\n    ghz = cirq.Circuit(  \n   cirq.H(qubits[0]),\n   for i in range (n-1):\n       cirq.CNOT ( qubits [i] , qubits [i+1]),\n   cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit),\n   cirq.measure (* qubits , key ='x'),. \n)\n\nThe syntax error is just after the \"for\" and \"Invalid syntax\"\n3)My original state is |GHZ><GHZ|+P*rho. Should I use cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit), in the part of ghz only, or should I use cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit), after defining my all state(I will first define |GHZ><GHZ and then (1-P)rho, and then I will write circuit =|GHZ><GHZ|+(1-P)rho after that cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit)) or should I use cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit) both part for all circuit and |GHZ><GHZ too\n\nI can create entangled state with hadamard and cnot gate but I want to create seperable state. How can I create seperable state with cirq\n\n5)For measurement, Should I measure each part seperately or should I first appending all circuit and then measured together? What I mean is that first I will measure |GHZ><GHZ| and then I will measure P*rho and after that I will add my circuit like circuit =|GHZ><GHZ|+(1-P)rho and simulate or Should I directly add and after that measure the all circuit?\nMany thanks from now\n", "answers": ["\n\nYou are running into basic python issues: trying to call a function with a list [r] instead of a float parameter. Also, the bit_flip channel then needs to be applied on a qubit. A potential fix is here:\n\nimport cirq\n\nalice, bob, charlie = cirq.LineQubit.range(3)\nrho_13 = cirq.Circuit(\n    cirq.H(alice),\n    cirq.CNOT(alice, charlie),\n    # you need a probability to have the channel defined\n    # then you'll need to apply the channel to a qubit\n    cirq.bit_flip(p=0.6)(charlie),\n    cirq.\nmeasure(alice,charlie),\n) \n\n\nThis is also fraught with Python issues. You are trying to create a circuit - but then passing in a for loop as an argument? cirq.final_density_matrix should not be part of the Circuit construction arguments for sure. Measurement can be part of the circuit but let's deal with that later as you have a question about that too.\n\nSumming states together only makes sense in the density matrix representation. From your three last questions (Producing |GHZ><GHZ| State in Cirq, Multiple Bipartite Entangled State in Cirq and this one) I'm gathering that you would like to put together a state that represents a mixture between the GHZ state and 4 states. So we'll have to\n\ncreate the density matrix for each of them,\nmultiply them with the required probabilities\nsum them together.\n\n\nYou need to tell us more about what kind of separable state you would like. |000><000| is one of the simplest separable ones - as it is |0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297|0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297|0\u27e9\u27e80||0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297|0\u27e9\u27e80|\u2297|0\u27e9\u27e80| - I'm going to assume that that's good enough. But any state that is the result of only local operations (i.e. one qubit operations) should be good enough.\n\nMeasurement is not required for your state preparation. If you want to measure your final state, I would add that at the end. Let's cover that as well.\n\n\nThere are two major ways that I can think of to solve this:\n\nusing density matrices directly\nusing mixtures of unitaries\n\nHere is an example for both - at the end the final density matrix is exactly the same.\n\nfrom typing import Union, Sequence, Tuple, Any\n\nimport cirq\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom cirq.type_workarounds import NotImplementedType\n\n\n# ======== Density matrix based method ============\n\na, b, c = cirq.LineQubit.range(3)\nGHZ_circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.H(a),\n                           cirq.CNOT(a, b),\n                           cirq.CNOT(b, c))\n\nGHZ = cirq.final_density_matrix(GHZ_circuit)\n\n\ndef density_matrix_bipartite_entangled(i, j, qs):\n    circuit = biparty_entangle_circuit(i, j, qs)\n    return cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit, qubit_order=qs)\n\n\ndef biparty_entangle_circuit(i, j, qs):\n    return cirq.Circuit(cirq.H(qs[i]), cirq.CNOT(qs[i], qs[j]))\n\n\nqs = [a, b, c]\n\nrho01 = density_matrix_bipartite_entangled(0, 1, qs)\nrho02 = density_matrix_bipartite_entangled(0, 2, qs)\nrho12 = density_matrix_bipartite_entangled(1, 2, qs)\n\n# creates the |+> \u2297 |1> \u2297 |0> state\ncircuit_separable = cirq.Circuit(cirq.H(a), cirq.X(b))\nrho_separable = cirq.final_density_matrix(circuit_separable, qubit_order=qs)\n\np, q, r, s = 0.5, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1\nassert 0 <= q + r + s <= 1\nassert 0 <= p <= 1\n\nrho = q * rho01 + r * rho02 + s * rho12 + (1 - q - r - s) * rho_separable\nstate = p * GHZ + (1 - p) * rho\n\nprint(f\"final state: \\n {state}\")\n\nprint(cirq.sample_density_matrix(state, indices=[0, 1, 2], repetitions=10))\n\n\n# ======== Mixture based method ============\n\nclass MixtureGate(cirq.Gate):\n    def __init__(self, p, q, r, s):\n        self.p = p\n        self.q = q\n        self.r = r\n        self.s = s\n\n    def _num_qubits_(self) -> int:\n        return 3\n\n    def _mixture_(self) -> Union[Sequence[Tuple[float, Any]],\n                                 NotImplementedType]:\n        p, q, r, s = self.p, self.q, self.r, self.s\n        rho01_gate = biparty_entangle_circuit(0, 1, qs).unitary(\n            qubits_that_should_be_present=qs)\n        rho02_gate = biparty_entangle_circuit(0, 2, qs).unitary(\n            qubits_that_should_be_present=qs)\n        rho12_gate = biparty_entangle_circuit(1, 2, qs).unitary(\n            qubits_that_should_be_present=qs)\n        separable_gate = circuit_separable.unitary(\n            qubits_that_should_be_present=qs)\n\n        return [\n            (p, GHZ_circuit.unitary()),\n            ((1 - p) * q, rho01_gate),\n            ((1 - p) * r, rho02_gate),\n            ((1 - p) * s, rho12_gate),\n            ((1 - p) * (1 - q - r - s), separable_gate),\n        ]\n\n\nfinal_circuit = cirq.Circuit(\n    MixtureGate(p, q, r, s)(a, b, c)\n)\ncircuit_based_state = cirq.final_density_matrix(final_circuit)\n\nprint(circuit_based_state)\n\n# we can do measurements here as well\n\nfinal_circuit.append(cirq.measure(a, b, c))\n\nr = cirq.DensityMatrixSimulator().run(program=final_circuit, repetitions=10)\nprint(\"Measurement results: \", r)\n\n## They are the same, yay!\nassert np.allclose(circuit_based_state, state)\n\n\n\n"], "comments": ["You are just perfect!
