{"question": "\nI am experimenting with some Qiskit ACQUA AI algorithms which require the following import statement:\nfrom datasets import *\n\nHowever, import statement is throwing an error:\nModuleNotFoundError\nTraceback (most recent call last) in\nfrom datasets import * \nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'datasets'\nI am unable to determine the package that this import is from. Clearly, Qiskit ACQUA installation doesn't have to all required packages for the algorithm code to run. I asked the question at the IBM QE forum but the traffic on it is very low. I have not had the answer from anyone yet.\nAny help would be most appreciated!\n", "answers": ["\n@DrHamed : you could have done this.\nfrom sklearn import datasets\n\nA lot of datasets are available in that import. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html\n"], "comments": ["I got some answers from another forum and I would like to share here. It turned out that the datasets library was a custom wrapper for the sklearn library. So it wasn't a library installed. To get around this, I navigated to the source and launched jupyter notebook, and that's when it worked. If I figure out a way to install all required librariries, I will be happy to share.
