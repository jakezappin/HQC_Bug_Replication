{"question": "\nI have NVIDIA GeForce GT740 Graphics card installed on my host machine with Windows 10 OS. I have to simulate a cluster environment in order to run qiskit codes in parallel fashion. Before actual Clustering, as POC I have created three ubuntu 20.04 VMs (one head and two compute nodes) on my host machine since qiskit-aer-gpu can be easily installed on Linux. I have used VMWare Workstation Pro for the purpose.\nNow on my head node I have created a venv and installed qiskit-aer-gpu along with CUDA\n\npython version: 3.8.10\n\nqiskit-aer-gpu version: 0.11.2\n\nnvcc version: Cuda compilation tools, release 10.1, V10.1.243\n\n\nI am running following code as an example just to verify cuda installation on my VM but it generates error\nfrom qiskit import *\nfrom qiskit.circuit.library import *\nfrom qiskit.providers.aer import *\nsim = AerSimulator(method= 'statevector', device='GPU')\nshots = 100\ndepth=10\nqubits = 25\ncircuit = transpile(QuantumVolume(qubits, depth, seed=0), backend=sim, optimization_level=0)\ncircuit.measure_all()\nresult = execute(circuit,sim,shots=shots,seed_simulator=12345).result()\n\nError is\nSimulation failed and returned the following error message:\nERROR: Failed to load qobj: No CUDA device available!\n\nUbuntu VM sees host GPU like sudo lshw -C display\n-display                 \n   description: VGA compatible controller\n   product: SVGA II Adapter\n   vendor: VMware\n   physical id: f\n   bus info: pci@0000:00:0f.0\n   version: 00\n   width: 32 bits\n   clock: 33MHz\n   capabilities: vga_controller bus_master cap_list rom\n   configuration: driver=vmwgfx latency=64\n   resources: irq:16 ioport:1070(size=16) \n   memory:e8000000-efffffff memory:fe000000-fe7fffff \n   memory:c0000-dffff\n\nI have seen some article in which VM doesnot have direct access to host GPU 1 and 2. Am I getting this no device error due to this reason?\nAny help will be appreciated.\n", "answers": ["\nThis might be an issue beyond qiskit-aer-gpu. To confirm or discard that, my to-go tool is PyTorch. Install pip install torch and run in a console:\nfrom torch.cuda import is_available\nis_available()\n\nIf True, submit an issue to https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer because it is, indeed, an Aer issue. If False, the problem is related to your environment and StackOverflow is probably a good place to ask.\n", "\ni am not sure , but dont you have to install cuQuantum first ?\nnote:i cant comment due to my reputation number\n"], "comments": ["Do i really have to? As cuQuantum is separate library from Nvidia and nothing to do with qiskit-aer-gpu. I have followed requirements from its github page"], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/32080/gpu-access-for-qiskit-aer-gpu-from-ubuntu-vm?r=SearchResults"}
