{"question": "\nimport qiskit.quantum_info as qi \ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(...)\nstate = qi.Statevector.from_instruction(circuit)\n\nto get the state of my quantum circuit.\nstate.draw(output='latex') then gives a nice representation of my state.\nThis works pretty well. The only issue is that when the states get a bit long the output starts looking like this:\n\nSome parts of the state are missing, replaced by dots. How do I force qiskit to display the entire state? Is there some way of increasing the size of the output cell? I'm using a jupyter notebook.\n", "answers": ["\nStatevector.draw method calls state_drawer function which in turn depends on _state_to_latex_ket function to generate the Latex representation.\n_state_to_latex_ket function accepts max_size parameter to set the maximum number of non-zero terms in the expression which defaults to 12.\nAs per documentation, if we set max_size to a large enough value when calling Statevector.draw, it should be passed to _state_to_latex_ket and the state shouldn't be truncated. However, it is not. It seems like a bug.\nA workaround is to use _state_to_latex_ket directly as follows:\nfrom IPython.display import Latex\nfrom qiskit.visualization import state_visualization\n\nprefix = \"$$\\\\begin{align}\"\nsuffix = \"\\\\end{align}$$\"\nstate_to_latex = state_visualization._state_to_latex_ket(state.data, max_size = 128)\n\nLatex(prefix + state_to_latex + suffix)\n\n"], "comments": [], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/23928/how-to-get-full-length-output-from-statevector-draw/23930?r=SearchResults#23930"}
