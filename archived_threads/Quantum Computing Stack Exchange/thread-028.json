{"question": "\nFor my dissertation I need to simulate random circuits and I have been trying to use google Cirq for that. Looking at the documentation I have seen how to create my own circuit and simulate it, but it becomes exhausting and prone to error the fact of creating a circuit for a larger number of quits and to produce as much entanglement as possible.\nI thought that Cirq would have any method for generating a random circuit for a given number of qubits, but unfortunately have not found anything like this. Therefore, I was wondering whether there is any tool or anyone who has generated circuits that I could import to use.\n", "answers": ["\nCirq does have some methods for generating random circuits, such as cirq.testing.random_circuit and cirq.random_rotations_between_grid_interaction_layers_circuit.\nThat being said, in my experience, generic random circuit methods almost never do quite exactly what I need. I suspect that, for thesis-level work, you will need much more careful control over the generated circuit than you will get from a method written by anyone except you.\n"], "comments": ["Is this what you are looking for?", "The first thing I have To do is simulate the circuit, obtain the amplitudes of the wavefunction and use Fourier decomposition to obtain the probability function for sampling the random circuit. I believe the second method that you wrote is what I am looking for! Thank you so much for it. I was looking for different method names so I will have to be a bit more careful in the future."], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/21469/random-circuits-with-google-cirq/21487?r=SearchResults#21487"}
