{"question": "\nI have the following circuit in qiskit. It is a simple CNOT operation with the control qubit set to 1, by running the control qubit through an X-gate.\nHowever, when I measure the 2nd qubit, I get the state |00\u27e9|00\u27e9,  not |11\u27e9|11\u27e9. \nIf I add a measurement of the control qubit, I do see |11\u27e9|11\u27e9 as the final result.\nI fully expected |11\u27e9|11\u27e9 as the outcome regardless of whether I measure a single or both qubits\nfrom qiskit import ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister, QuantumCircuit\nfrom qiskit import execute\nfrom qiskit import BasicAer\nfrom math import *\nq0 = QuantumRegister(2, \"q0\") # one ancilla qubit\nc0 = ClassicalRegister(2, \"c0\") # n classical bits for output\nqc = QuantumCircuit(q0,c0)\nqc.x(q0[0])\nqc.cx(q0[0], q0[1])\n  #qc.measure(q0[0],c0[0]) <= when commented out I measure |00>\nqc.measure(q0[1],c0[1])\nqc.draw()\n job = execute(qc,backend=BasicAer.get_backend('qasm_simulator'))\n job.result().get_counts()\n\n\n", "answers": ["\nThanks for pointing this out. This is a bug that occurs when only a subset of the qubits are measured.\nIt's being fixed. Until then, workarounds are:\n\nUse Aer instead of BasicAer (always the best thing to do when possible).\nUse LegacySimulators instead of BasicAer (this will give a deprecation warning).\nInstall Qiskit from the master branch, where the issue has been fixed (here be dragons!).\n\n"], "comments": ["This is not an answer (but I'm not allowed to comment as a newbie!). I saw something similar with BasicAer and posted a bug report in the Aer provider. It seems that BasicAer might be part of Terra instead, so maybe I posted in the wrong place. In my case, I get the expected behavior with Aer, but not with BasicAer. github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/70"], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/5597/for-cnot-gate-with-control-qubit-set-to-1-the-measured-state-of-the-second-qubi/5612?r=SearchResults#5612"}
