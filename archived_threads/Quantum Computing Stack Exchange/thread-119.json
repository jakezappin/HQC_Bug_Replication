However, when I try to import the package, I get the following error message:\nImportError: cannot import name 'BaseBackend' from 'qiskit.providers'\nIt seems that it is likely an issue with Qiskit Aqua since that has since been deprecated and broken up into specific applications, algorithms, etc.\nI tried creating a new environment and starting with a fresh install of Qiskit, but that also led to the same error. Is anyone else having this issue? Thanks!\nThe full error message is:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nImportError                               Traceback (most recent call last)\nInput In [22], in <cell line: 6>()\n      1 # from qiskit.finance import QiskitFinanceError\n      2 # from qiskit.finance.data_providers import *\n      3 # import warnings\n      4 # warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\n----> 6 import qiskit.finance as qf\n      7 from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters\n      8 register_matplotlib_converters()\n\nFile ~\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\qiskit\\finance\\__init__.py:45, in <module>\n      1 # This code is part of Qiskit.\n      2 #\n      3 # (C) Copyright IBM 2019, 2021.\n   (...)\n     10 # copyright notice, and modified files need to carry a notice indicating\n     11 # that they have been altered from the originals.\n     12 \"\"\"\n     13 ===============================================\n     14 Qiskit's finance module (:mod:`qiskit.finance`)\n   (...)\n     42 \n     43 \"\"\"\n---> 45 from qiskit.aqua.deprecation import warn_package\n     46 from .exceptions import QiskitFinanceError\n     47 from ._logging import (get_qiskit_finance_logging,\n     48                        set_qiskit_finance_logging)\n\nFile ~\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\qiskit\\aqua\\__init__.py:76, in <module>\n     74 from .missing_optional_library_error import MissingOptionalLibraryError\n     75 from .aqua_globals import aqua_globals\n---> 76 from .quantum_instance import QuantumInstance\n     77 from .algorithms import QuantumAlgorithm\n     78 from ._logging import (QiskitLogDomains,\n     79                        get_logging_level,\n     80                        set_logging_level,\n   (...)\n     83                        get_qiskit_aqua_logging,\n     84                        set_qiskit_aqua_logging)\n\nFile ~\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\qiskit\\aqua\\quantum_instance.py:21, in <module>\n     18 import time\n     19 import numpy as np\n---> 21 from qiskit.providers import Backend, BaseBackend\n     22 from qiskit.transpiler import CouplingMap, PassManager\n     23 from qiskit.transpiler.layout import Layout\n\n", "answers": ["\nThe latest version of the Finance tutorials are here https://qiskit.org/documentation/finance/tutorials/index.html I suggest starting there where you will find an updated version of the one you referenced, which is quite old now from an earlier version of qiskit (0.24).
