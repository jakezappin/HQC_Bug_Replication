{"question": "\nI need to use a random Clifford operator and add it to another circuit. However, the Clifford operator does not seem to be there after application of compose. An example code which illustrates the problem is:\nimport qiskit as qk\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import random_clifford\nfrom qiskit.quantum_info import Clifford\n\nqc = qk.QuantumCircuit(3)\nU = random_clifford(3,seed=123)\nU = Clifford.to_circuit(U)\nqc.compose(U,qubits=[0,1,2])\nqc.draw(\"mpl\")\n\nIf I draw U alone, it gives a nice example of a random Clifford gate. Thus, I guess the error lies in the application of compose, but how can I solve this? It does not throw an error, it just does not happen anything.\n", "answers": ["\nBy default, compose() method returns the composed circuit and keep the original circuit unchanged. For in-place composition, you need to set inplace parameter to True:\nqc.compose(U,qubits=[0,1,2], inplace=True)\n\n"], "comments": ["perfect, thank you!"], "link": "https://quantumcomputing.stackexchange.com//questions/31508/why-does-composing-a-clifford-circuit-to-another-circuit-not-work-qiskit?r=SearchResults"}
