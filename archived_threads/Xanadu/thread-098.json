According to your answer, I tried to change this number or delete this line of code, but the result did not change. I don\u2019t know where this line of code is reflected in the whole program, or can you answer why setting this line of code can ensure the reproducibility of the result?

You can have more information about this function and alternatives in the numpy documentation.\nYou can more easily see the role this function is playing with this small example:\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(42)\nnp.random.rand(5)\n\nIf you run several times this piece of code you\u2019ll see that the numbers will always be the same.\nYou can now try with:\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(101010)\nnp.random.rand(5)\n\nand you will see that the numbers are different but always the same.\nIn the Quantum advantage with Gaussian Boson Sampling tutorial notebook you can see the difference between different seeds, or the absence of one, in the results printed by the 6th cell:\n# Fock states to measure at output\nmeasure_states = [(0,0,0,0), (1,1,0,0), (0,1,0,1), (1,1,1,1), (2,0,0,0)]\n\n# extract the probabilities of calculating several\n# different Fock states at the output, and print them out\nfor i in measure_states:\n    print(f\"|{''.join(str(j) for j in i)}>: {probs[i]}\")\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/gaussian-boson-sampling/1630/4"}, "4": {"author": "hhx", "date": "1643098026823", "content": "In the sample code of Gaussian Bose sampling, what role does the random seed set play?\nnp.random.seed(42)", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/gaussian-boson-sampling/1630/5"}}
