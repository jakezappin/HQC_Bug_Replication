So even if the other gates and weights are all the same, CNOTs make a huge difference in how the circuit works.\nRunning the same circuit on different simulators should work the same if the simulation parameters are the same. Notice that in some cases there are random numbers being created under the hood in these simulators so you should take this into account, and in some cases the simulators include noise so they won\u2019t show the same result as an ideal simulator. Also be careful to specify the same number of shots for both simulators. Even computer numerical precision can come to add a very slight difference between simulators. Remember that simulators are programs running on classical machines, which are trying to simulate how a quantum computer would behave. If the way these simulators are built is different, it\u2019s possible that you can get a different answer even if they should be the same in theory.\nEnsemble classification can use a lot of classical and quantum computational resources. It\u2019s unclear to me whether there will be a practical advantage of using this method compared to purely classical classification. This is sounds like an interesting research question though so please let us know here if you get any further insights on this!\n1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/logical-question-regarding-ensemble-classification-notebook/3346/3"}, "3": {"author": "Kshitij_Dave", "date": "1692687167267", "content": "I have question regarding your 2nd point \u2013\nI think the point of ensemble classification is to see which simulators performs better classification on different instances.
