Welcom to the forum !\nReally cool project! What I recommend doing is to start simpler. Based on your notebook, it looks like you\u2019re trying to implement this paper 13. The recurrent unit is relatively complicated!\nWhat I suggest for a \u201csimpler\u201d QRNN is as follows. You can keep the same circuit design as in the paper referenced above, but the bulk of your RNN recurrent unit can literally just be that circuit, where the measurements are, say, Pauli Z expectations in your embedded space. Then, you can have a classical processing layer (a softmax layer) to turn the measurement data from your quantum RNN into a probability vector (the final output of your recurrent cell).\nOn paper this should work! Try this out and see if you can get that functioning (it may not be very \u201ctrainable\u201d, per se, but this simpler algorithm should still have the same properties of any other RNN).", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/how-to-do-long-short-term-memory-with-pennylane/2099/2"}, "2": {"author": "Aadi_Tiwari", "date": "1660322152276", "content": "thank you so much for replying! to be honest though i understood very little of what you said since i am very new to pennylane, and was wondering if you could give me a resource to help me learn regression with pennylane", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/how-to-do-long-short-term-memory-with-pennylane/2099/3"}, "3": {"author": "isaacdevlugt", "date": "1660334322929", "content": "Hey!
