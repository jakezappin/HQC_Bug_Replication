Thank you for using them and sharing your love for them!\nI think the problem you\u2019re having is related to the data you\u2019re inputting.\nI ran the following code and I got no errors. You should check the dimensions in your data to make sure that whatever goes into the Displacement gate is a single float.\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\n\ndev = qml.device(\"strawberryfields.tf\", wires=1, cutoff_dim=10)\n\ndef layer(v):\n    qml.CVNeuralNetLayers(*v, wires=list(range(num_qubits)))\n    \n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef quantum_neural_net(var, x):\n    \n    # Encode input x into quantum state\n    for i in range(num_qubits):\n        #qml.Rotation(x, wires=i)\n        qml.Displacement(x, 0.0, wires=i)\n    \n    layer(var)\n\n    return qml.expval(qml.X(0))\n\nnp.random.seed(0)\nnum_qubits = 1\n\nshapes = qml.CVNeuralNetLayers.shape(n_layers=3, n_wires=num_qubits)\nweights = [np.random.random(shape) for shape in shapes]\nx = 0.1\n\nquantum_neural_net(weights, x)\n\nPlease let me know if this solves your problem, or otherwise please share a minimal version of your code, with an example of your \u2018X_data\u2019 after all of the processing that you perform.\nHopefully this helps you solve the problem!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/sending-qonn-to-photonic-backend/2198/2"}, "2": {"author": "Sergio", "date": "1665037602781", "content": "Thanks a lot @CatalinaAlbornoz, indeed I already set a float into Displacement gate, but I will have a look at my code twice to dig in my issue.\nRegards!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/sending-qonn-to-photonic-backend/2198/3"}, "3": {"author": "CatalinaAlbornoz", "date": "1665104918918", "content": "Let us know if you find the issue @Sergio!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/sending-qonn-to-photonic-backend/2198/4"}, "4": {"author": "Sergio", "date": "1664870417471", "content": "Hi,\nThis is my first message here, then I would like to thank all Xanadu staff for this fantastic library, I am deeply in love with it.\nI am fitting a Fano resonance over 20 scattered points I obtained in the lab with SF, I got some good results on fitting with the simulator and I would like to send the code to the photonic backend X8, please can you point me some information about how to measure the outcome?
