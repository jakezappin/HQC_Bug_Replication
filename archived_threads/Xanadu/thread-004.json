Interesting question\u2026\nLet me try and rephrase your question to see if I understand:\n\nAssuming that you have a quantum circuit that produces quantum states in the computational basis with real and positive coefficients, can a classical neural network learn the associated probability distribution and extrapolate a wavefunction by taking the square root \\psi(x) = \\sqrt{p(x)}?\n\nThe answer is yes .
