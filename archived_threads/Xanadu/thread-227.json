Welcome to the forum! \nI\u2019m not able to replicate your error \u2014 the code executes perfectly fine for me . Are you using the most up-to-date version of PennyLane? If you print qml.__version__ it should say 0.29.1 (at the time of writing). If you\u2019re under that, you can upgrade via pip install --upgrade pennylane.\nLet me know if that helps!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/density-matrix-demo-issue/2865/2"}, "2": {"author": "Chris23233", "date": "1682108322911", "content": "Thank you for your help Isaac!\nIt looks like I somehow missed the wires = 2 argument in the dev line.
