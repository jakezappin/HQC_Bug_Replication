Even if you didn\u2019t take a look at the right side in previous nodes, now that you\u2019ve reached A.4, it might be worth it to take a quick look at the earlier nodes, where we go through the algorithm from a more \u2018theoretical\u2019 side and step-by-step.\nThe problem is set up so you can be guaranteed to find at least one solution if there\u2019s an odd number of solutions. The way you measure has you testing in pairs, and you get the number of solutions mod 2 \u2014 so if there are 2 solutions present in the pair, you see the same result as if there were zero. However, at least one of the pairs will return a different phase, and you will be able to detect that.\nSo you might want to think again about the value of the solution parity when you detect a phase change. Parity just means us saying if a number is odd or even. In the case of getting 1 when you take mod 2 of a number, the parity of that number would be odd.\nI\u2019m not sure what your code looks like in this codercise, so I can\u2019t fully comment on your second question (if you feel comfortable sharing your code, feel free ), but I hope it\u2019s starting to make sense what the multisol_pair_circuit function from the A.4.1 codercise is trying to do.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/ex-a-4-2-why-does-the-parity-need-to-be-1-when-no-solution-or-two-solution-is-found/3575/2"}, "2": {"author": "jag", "date": "1698056710066", "content": "Hi @Ivana_at_Xanadu , thank you for the response.

Instead of writing out the whole definition of the multisol_pair_circuit function, you can call it directly in your code.
