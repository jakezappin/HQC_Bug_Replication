Considering the code screenshots you\u2019ve shared, I\u2019m not exactly certain where that is caused though, as both j and k should be integers if they are coming from range. My suspicion is that image is possibly in the incorrect format in order to be indexed in this way, but it\u2019s hard to tell just from screenshots.\nAre you able to share a non-screenshot version of your code, to make it easier to help debug? e.g., paste the entire code here in a post, or share a jupyter notebook link.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/type-error-in-qnn-algorithm/2580/3"}, "3": {"author": "priyaltaneja", "date": "1676676076425", "content": "Hey!
