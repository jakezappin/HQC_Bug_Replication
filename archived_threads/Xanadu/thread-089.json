Please, see the \u201cExample\u201d section here 11 illustrating how the user can provide custom observables to build a Hamiltonian object.\nIf your question points in a different direction, feel free to elaborate/provide more details about your specific problem and we would be happy to help with this.\nThank you!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/qml-hamiltonian/1047/2"}, "2": {"author": "Antonio_Mele", "date": "1621267413322", "content": "Hi @Alain_Delgado_Gran, thanks for your reply.\nHamiltonian  class has no attribute eigvals  which could allow me to compute its spectrum.\nI am using it in order to deal with class ExpvalCost, because I think that it allows me to save time in implementing VQE.\nIn order to benchmark the result of my VQE, it would be comfortable if I can extract also the exact ground state energy directly by this Hamiltonian.
