When you say \u201chow many physical qubits do you use for a logical qubit\u201d, are you referring to Borealis? If so, Borealis demonstrated quantum computational advantage with 216 qubits.\nThe next half of your question is a pretty hard one to answer! There\u2019s reasonable consensus in the community that a 1 million qubit, fault-tolerant device is needed. How long will that take?

So, it\u2019s not that a device \u201chas\u201d logical qubits, per se. A quantum device has physical qubits that can function as logical qubits for the purposes of the task it\u2019s programmed to perform.\nLogical qubits are useful entities in error-correcting protocols in that they hinge on redundancy as a defence mechanism for qubit decoherence. The downside here is that we need more qubits to do this! With the technology that underpins Borealis, though, there are more modest overheads in comparison to other technologies when encoding error-corrected logical qubits into physical qubits because of its architecture. You can read more about it here 1.\nThere are some subtleties and nuances here, but I hope that this helps!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/quantum-advantage/2843/10"}, "10": {"author": "Jack_Hausmann", "date": "1681658644001", "content": "Hello,\nhow many physical qubits do you use for a logical qubit and can you say how many physical qubits your quantum computer would need to have in order to be universally usable and approximately how long it takes to build such a quantum computer?", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/quantum-advantage/2843/11"}}
