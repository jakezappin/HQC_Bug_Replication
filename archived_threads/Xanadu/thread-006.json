Is that right?\nIf that\u2019s the case then you can use our AmplitudeEmbedding 1 template.\nYou could use it as follows:\nimport pennylane as qml\nfrom pennylane import numpy as np\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit',wires=2)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(f):\n    qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(features=f, wires=range(2))\n    return qml.state()\n\nprint(circuit(f=[1/2, 1/2, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]))\nqml.draw_mpl(circuit)(f=[1/2, 1/2, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0])\n\nAs you can see in the output, the probability amplitudes are what you included in \u2018f\u2019.\nNow, if what you want to see is samples, then you can try adding a number of shots to the device and then getting \u2018samples\u2019 as the return.\ndev = qml.device('default.qubit',wires=2, shots=10)\n\n@qml.qnode(dev)\ndef circuit(f):\n    qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(features=f, wires=range(2))    \n    return qml.sample(qml.PauliZ(0)), qml.sample(qml.PauliZ(1))\n\nprint(circuit(f=[1/2, 1/2, 1/np.sqrt(2), 0]))\n\nI ran this once and got\n[[ 1 -1 -1  1  1 -1 -1  1  1  1]\n[ 1  1  1  1 -1  1  1  1 -1  1]]\nThe first line is the first qubit and the second line is the second qubit. A \u20181\u2019 means that the qubit was on the |0\u27e9 state, and a \u2018-1\u2019 means that the qubit was in the |1\u27e9 state.\nWhat you can see from the results is that every time you get a |1\u27e9 state in the first qubit you get a |0\u27e9 state in the second one.\nPlease let me know if this solves your question!\nI also encourage you to read this \u2018how-to\u2019 about measurements in PennyLane.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/how-can-i-get-the-amplitude-of-qubit-after-collapse/2151/3"}, "3": {"author": "cheng", "date": "1663158681416", "content": "Hi @CatalinaAlbornoz,\nThanks for your reply.
