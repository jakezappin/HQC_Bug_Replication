It will show you exactly how you can figure this out using both physics/mathematics and code!\nAs a short answer, you can, for example, calculate the inner product of two normalized states (one as a bra, the other as a ket), and see if you get a 1 (same state), a 0 (orthogonal states), or some other number (something in between).\nI can really recommend that you take some time checking out these topics in the Codebook \u2014 the examples can be really helpful.
