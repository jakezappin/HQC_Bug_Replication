You can create a virtual environment with Conda and install PennyLane as follows:\n\nInstall Anaconda following the instructions here.\nOpen your terminal (mac) or command line (Windows).\nCreate a new Conda environment with: conda create --name     <name_of_your_environment> python=3.10\nActivate the environment with: conda activate <name_of_your_environment>\nInstall PennyLane with: python -m pip install pennylane\nInstall other useful packages with: python -m pip install pennylane     jupyter matplotlib\n\nNote that you will be installing 3 packages here: PennyLane, Jupyter, and Matplotlib. You don\u2019t necessarily need the three of them but they tend to be useful. Also, note that where it says <name_of_your_environment> you can choose any name that you want. After this you can write jupyter notebook in your terminal/command line and you will be ready to create programs using PennyLane.\nYou can also watch the video here for detailed PennyLane installation instructions.\nIf you have trouble installing PennyLane locally, you can use Google Colab and open a new notebook there. Run the following at the beginning of your notebook (including the exclamation mark): !pip install pennylane\nIf you\u2019re still facing issues please post your code and your full error traceback.\nI hope this helps you get started!1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/i-installed-pennylane-and-networkx-regularly-on-google-colab-o-s-windows-and-when-i-import-pennylane-i-get-this-error-importerror-cannot-import-name-dispatch-from-networkx-classes-usr-local-lib-python3-10-dist-packages-networkx-classes-init/3561/4"}, "4": {"author": "Eleonora_Panini", "date": "1697723516727", "content": "Thank you, now pennylane works also in local, but I get the same error of the code in Google Colab when I run the quantum gan demo adapted on my dataset : stack overflow.
