Sorry for not mentioning this!\nThe PR I linked above isn\u2019t high on the priority list for our team, but it really should get some attention because the issue you\u2019re bringing up is a bit of a bug \u2014 cutoff_dim can be passed into the gaussian backend (e.g., eng = sf.Engine(\"gaussian\", backend_options={\"cutoff_dim\": 6}) ), but cutoff_dim isn\u2019t actually being utilized under the hood .\nFor the time being, you can still access this added feature by building StrawberryFields from source on that branch. I would first create a new virtual python environment where you can have this \u201ccustom\u201d SF version (includes the new feature). Once you do that, you can install via:\npython -m pip install git+https://github.com/XanaduAI/strawberryfields.git@measure-fock-gaussian-backend-cutoff\n\nLet me know if this works!1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/increase-cutoff-measurefock-gaussian-backend/3052/4"}, "4": {"author": "Hendrik", "date": "1686820222886", "content": "Is it possible to increase the cutoff dimension for gaussian backend when measuring fock states.
