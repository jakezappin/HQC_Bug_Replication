In this approach you should first generate your samples using GBS, and then pass them to feature_vector_orbits_sampling. Hence, you should follow the code in the X8 tutorial to generate samples, and then pass the result through feature_vector_orbits_sampling.\nHowever, while the above approach can work in principle for arbitrary graphs of your choice, the main restriction is due to the current hardware. As you can see here 2, the range of graphs supported on the present X8 chips is quite limited, i.e., bipartite graphs with a special type of spectrum. If your own graphs satisfy this criteria, then you should be able to use the hardware. Otherwise, it may be best to use the simulator for now.1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/graph-similarity/1121/5"}, "5": {"author": "_risto", "date": "1624320902226", "content": "Hi @Tom_Bromley\nWhat do you mean by spectrum?
