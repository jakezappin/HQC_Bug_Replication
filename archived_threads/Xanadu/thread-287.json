If you have many gates then you can make this probability higher. This is almost exactly what you proposed so congrats on the good intuition!\nThis tutorial can help you learn more about noise in circuits. https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_noisy_circuits.html 11\nRegarding the question about default.mixed, it actually inherits from qml.QubitDevice, which in turn inherits from qml.device. The lightning.qubit, which is still in beta, is written in a C++ backend so this is why it runs faster.\nSpeeding-up simulations is always a big question. There are some techniques that you can use, which won\u2019t solve the problem completely but they can help you. For instance, running small problems before you go to the big one. This will help you troubleshoot and make sure that you\u2019re getting the answer you want. Once you\u2019re confident that everything\u2019s working you can simulate the larger problem, and let it run during the night or during the weekend.\nPlease let me know if this helped!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/noisy-circuits-simulations-for-qml/1350/2"}, "2": {"author": "Zohim_Chandani1", "date": "1631625131862", "content": "Just trying to understand how noise modelling works with Pennylane.\nIf I have a wire with a bunch of gates ending with qml.RY(2, wires=1) followed by qml.BitFlip(0.1, wires=1), does this mean that a bitflip error would be applied to all the gates on the wire or just following the application of the RY gate?\nIf the answer is the latter, is there a way to define a bitflip error model which acts globally on the whole circuit rather than having to add it after each gate on each qubit?\nGiven a noisy simulation, one has to use the default.mixed device.
