The composition of unitary matrices is a single unitary matrix.\nThe CV model offers unitary gates, displacement gate, and nonlinear gates in a greater number than in the qubit-based model, offering much more parameters. That enables the data encoding circuit to encode a greater number of features from data.\nI am observing some promising results.\nI think the CV model is better suited for machine learning, where the features of data are continuous in nature.
