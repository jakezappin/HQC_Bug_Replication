The CSWAP operator, which I believe is being called under the hood when you call qml.ctrl(qml.SWAP), is a three-qubit operator. I assume your error message is something like this:\nValueError: CSWAP: wrong number of wires. 2 wires given, 3 expected. \nIn your case, you\u2019re specifying that you want the control qubit to be wire  0. Then, you are specifying that the target qubits be wire 0 and wire 1, where wire 0 is already being used as the control qubit!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/f-2-cswap-error/2078/2"}, "2": {"author": "simsaidan", "date": "1659670530381", "content": "For this circuit, I am not sure why the cswap is leading to an error.
