Least squares is a good metric when you have real values but in this case it may be better to consider using the trace distance 2.\nWe use the trace distance in our demo on The Variational Quantum Thermalizer 2. You will also find an interesting discussion about this in this thread 1.\nPlease let me know if this is helpful!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/least-square-and-optimization-of-a-complex-function/2041/2"}, "2": {"author": "sassan_moradi", "date": "1658235008485", "content": "Many thanks.
