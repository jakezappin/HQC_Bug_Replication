When we only apply local gates to each qubit, we can represent each qubit\u2019s state with just a 2-dimensional vector. However, as soon as we use a non-local gate (like the CNOT), this picture no longer works!\nInstead, we have to consider the joint system (q[0], q[1]), which is represented by a 4-dimensional vector (one dimension for each possible computational basis state of the joint system (00, 01, 10, 11) ). Then multiplying by a CNOT (which is represented by a 4x4 matrix) makes sense.\nThis is exactly the phenomenon of entanglement. We can no longer describe the joint system using the individual subsystems.1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/help-me-to-understand-the-quantum-circuit/427/2"}, "2": {"author": "Akshat_Suwalka", "date": "1592194131395", "content": "Thank you @nathan for your reply!\nqml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))\nWhat is the meaning of the above line?\nwhat I understand is that the pauliZ gate is applied at the final i.e after CNOT gate to the second qubit and then calculating the expectation value of the second qubit.\nMy question is that now if they are in entangled state then how expectation value of individual qubit can be calculated like here the expectation value of second qubit is calculating?", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/help-me-to-understand-the-quantum-circuit/427/3"}, "3": {"author": "josh", "date": "1592222862403", "content": "Hi @Akshat_Suwalka,\nqml.expval(qml.PauliZ(1))\n\nin PennyLane translates to computing \\langle \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\mid I\\otimes Z\\mid\\psi(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\rangle.
