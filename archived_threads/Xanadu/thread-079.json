Remember though that this function gives you the norm of a vector, but it doesn\u2019t normalize it. For example: the norm of the vector [2,0] is 2 so np.linalg.norm() will return the integer 2. The question instead asks you to return the normalized vector, so in this example you should return [1,0].\nPlease let me know if this helps you!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/exercise-l-1-1-in-the-codebook-exercise-section/2016/2"}, "2": {"author": "Tejas_Limaye", "date": "1656999539054", "content": "\nimage532\u00d7518 13.2 KB\n\nEven after writing this code I\u2019m unable to get the output.

Here we\u2019re normalizing the quantum state [a\u2019,b\u2019]. Notice that this is not the same as saying a\u2019^2 = 1 and b\u2019^2 = 1. In fact, if this happens we would get a\u2019^2+b\u2019^2 = 2.\nLet\u2019s test your code with some random example.\nLet\u2019s say that alpha = 0.2 and beta = 2.\na1 = 0.2 and a2 = 2.\nNow, ans1 = 0.2/0.2 = 1 and ans2 = 2/2=1.\nSo in fact ans1^2 + ans2^2 = 2\nI hope this helps you understand your error and find the correct solution!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/exercise-l-1-1-in-the-codebook-exercise-section/2016/4"}, "4": {"author": "Tejas_Limaye", "date": "1657089893348", "content": "That helps a lot, thanks Catalina", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/exercise-l-1-1-in-the-codebook-exercise-section/2016/5"}, "5": {"author": "Tejas_Limaye", "date": "1656964154468", "content": "I am unable to use np.linalg.norm() or np.angle() function to normalize the complex state vector coefficients.
