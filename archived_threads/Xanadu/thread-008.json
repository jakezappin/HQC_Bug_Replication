The AmplitudeEmbedding template is designed to be a state preparation at the start of the circuit. I\u2019m not aware of any device that supports this partway through a circuit. However, the  MottonenStatePreparation 17 template works by defining a circuit that performs the transformation\nU |0> = |psi>\n\nSince it defines a subcircuit, it can be used at any point within a larger circuit. However, note that the action of MottonenStatePreparation partway through a circuit will not be to reset the state to |psi>. Instead, it will apply the unitary - only U|0> will prepare |psi>, for example U|1> might prepare something else.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/about-amplitude-embedding/905/2"}, "2": {"author": "sassan_moradi", "date": "1615459153364", "content": "many thanks for your clarification, Tom.", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/about-amplitude-embedding/905/3"}, "3": {"author": "Tom_Bromley", "date": "1615466447715", "content": "No problem @sassan_moradi!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/about-amplitude-embedding/905/4"}, "4": {"author": "sassan_moradi", "date": "1615387024585", "content": "i took a look at Amplitude embedding method in Pennylane.
