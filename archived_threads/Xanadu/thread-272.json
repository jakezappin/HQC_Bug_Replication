I encourage you to look at how the values alpha_0, alpha_1 and alpha_2 are calculated in our advanced Borealis tutorial 2.\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/what-are-the-allowed-rgate-bsgate-and-sgate-values-for-borealis/2339/2"}, "2": {"author": "Samarth_Sandeep", "date": "1672176291032", "content": "This worked and helped a lot!
