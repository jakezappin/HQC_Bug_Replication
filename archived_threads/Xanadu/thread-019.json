This prepares the given state by using the required gates.\nIf you use a PennyLane plugin that supports a quantum simulator device like PennyLane\u2019s default.qubit or Qiskit, this function simulates your state. If you use a PennyLane plugin that supports a quantum hardware device like Forest SDK, it should correspond to initialising this state in the hardware.\nThe documention says that it doesn\u2019t work on all device, I could not find on which devices it works.\nThis refers to the fact that QubitStateVector (and hence AmplitudeEmbedding) is a qubit state preparation function. Hence, it will only work with devices that simulate discrete variable computing. It will not work if you use default.gaussian device, for example. You can use this with default.qubit, Rigetti Forest SDK, Qiskit plugins.1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/amplitudeembedding/169/2"}, "2": {"author": "barthelemymp", "date": "1562852094339", "content": "Hello,\nThank you for the answer but I\u2019m not sure to understand.\nMy question is to know if AmplitudeEmbedding and so if QubitStateVector is a part of a circuit, composed by the appropriate series of gates, or if it is just accessing the state and modifying the value directly.\nAnother way to ask would be Is AmplitudeEmbedding working on real quantum computers or only on simulator.\nIn fact for my current project I need to compare different Embedding into a quantum state. That\u2019s why I need to take into account the size of the part of the circuit that would really encode the feature in the proper quantum state (size/time).", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/amplitudeembedding/169/3"}, "3": {"author": "josh", "date": "1562861770016", "content": "Hi @barthelemymp. The way QubitStateVector is implemented depends on the plugin device.\nFor example, the default.qubit implementation directly sets the wavefunction amplitude value.\nforest.qvm, on the other hand, is a hardware device, and implements QubitStateVector by decomposing it into multiple Pauli-X gates.\nSo amplitude encoding does work on both simulators and hardware devices.1", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/amplitudeembedding/169/4"}, "4": {"author": "barthelemymp", "date": "1563460979313", "content": "Thank you.
