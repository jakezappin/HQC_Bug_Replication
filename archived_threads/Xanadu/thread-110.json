Likely it is because it is trying to use a Linux environment variable,  LD_LIBRARY_PATH , inside windows. You can read more about this issue here:\n\n\ngithub.com/pyscf/pyscf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not defined' when installing pyscf 2\n\n\n\n        opened \n\n\n\nMar 26, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n          ccullip\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm attempting to install pyscf on Windows using `pip install pyscf`.

Is it even possible to install pyscf in windows using pip? How would I go about fixing this? \n\nPython version: 3.6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey suggest to use Windows subsystem for Linux to get around this difficulty since they do not officially support the former OS.\nHope his helps,\nNicolas", "link": "https://discuss.pennylane.ai//t/qchem-module-installation-error/545/2"}, "2": {"author": "george", "date": "1598862483485", "content": "Hi - I don\u2019t seem to be able to install the qchem module on a windows machine.
