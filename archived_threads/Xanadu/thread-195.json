I\u2019m wondering if anyone has encountered this error: I am trying to build a circuit with a noisy channel by adding a bit flip to an arbitrary qubit (in a three-qubit circuit), but I get an error saying that the BitFlip gate is not supported on the default.qubit device. I assumed that since the bit flip is a qubit operation it would work on a qubit device (rather than, say, a Gaussian device). I haven\u2019t been able to find a solution yet, so any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n Solved by josh in post #2 \n\n\n                Hi @jfalla! To use qml.BitFlip, you will need to use the default.mixed mixed-state simulator.
